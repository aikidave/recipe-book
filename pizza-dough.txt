Pizza Dough

1 package active dry yeast
1 cup warm water
1 tablespoon sugar
2 tablespoons olive oil
2 cups all-purpose flour (plus more as needed)

1. In a large mixing bowl, combine the yeast, warm water, and sugar, mixing
   gently until combined. Allow the mixture to rest for about 5 minutes, or
   until bubbly.

   (If your yeast does not bubble, toss the batch and do this step again, as you
   most likely have “dead” yeast.)

2. Add the olive oil, flour, and salt, adding more flour as necessary until
   forming a soft dough. The dough should pull away from the sides of the bowl
   and should feel just a little sticky. On a lightly floured surface, knead the
   dough for 5 to 7 minutes, or until elastic. Place the dough in a well-oiled
   bowl, covered, in a warm place for about 1 hour, or until dough has doubled
   in bulk.

3. When the dough has doubled in bulk, punch it down and turn it out onto a
   lightly floured surface. Knead the dough for several minutes until smooth and
   elastic.
